# Looking Back

Going into this project I had a lot of concerns about machine learning (ML) with regards to sourcing the data used in training, curating that data for training, understanding what/how ML is doing/computing, and results were affecting people. Now at the end, those concerns are re-affirmed.

## Curating Data


training, which images from a set, how many, easy to drop those that don't work (outliers, non-conformers)

technical - mirroring, likeness, loss of humanness from movement. Holes/gaps in latent space. Some quick, some not, 



## Understanding Data


shocking differences between trainings sets - makes it less clear what's really going on.


how a NN is both algorithm and database combined



## Effect


reinforcement learning -> really builds stereotypes
