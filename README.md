This repository archives the artistic research results from the production grants Leonardo Rebooted: https://quoartis.org/project/leonardo-rebooted/

This specific category of grant was Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing.


# Abstract
Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AIML) are rapidly changing nearly every aspect of post-modern life; but, do we really understand it? Quantum Computing will only accelerate the adoption of AIML as the new algorithm(s) for universal computability. Explainable AI (XAI) is a burgeoning field of research with the goal of opening the black-box of AIML and explaining how it works. This is typically from the technical standpoint of calculating and demonstrating input to output connections with the hope of generating more trust in AIML. The intent of this proposal is to create and reveal the inner workings of an AIML from a visual arts standpoint - visual arts XAI.

# Concept
Create a short audiovisual video/animation from AIML trained by the artist that self- exposes latent space navigation and neural net layer interaction. Ideally, the final AIML agent(s) will be fully autonomous - meaning that audiovisuals could be generated by the AIML agent infinitely.
Additionally, the artist will publish/open source any code, discoveries, and how-to instructions on github.
Philosophical musings and written products may occur and primarily framed within Flusser's concept of the Technical Image.
