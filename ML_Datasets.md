# Machine Learning Datasets

The data used for machine learning (ML) is critical.

 - biases, references
 - reinforcement learning, perpetuation of stereotypes


The datasets used in this project were captured from volunteers who were compenstated for their time and fully aware of the extent to which their likeness could be used. They were asked to ....


in front of a camera for a length of time between 10 and 30 min. This video was down-sampled into 1 frame per second (fps) and 10 fps sequences. The 1 fps sequence was used to quickly pre-train the neural net (NN) and set a quick baseline. Then the 10 fps image dataset was used for adding further detail into the NN.
