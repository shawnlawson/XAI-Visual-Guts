The datasets used in this project were captured from volunteers who were compenstated for their time and fully aware of the extent to which their likeness could be used. They were asked to sign a release form.


in front of a camera for a length of time between 10 and 30 min. This video was down-sampled into 1 frame per second (fps) and 10 fps sequences. The 1 fps sequence was used to quickly pre-train the neural net (NN) and set a quick baseline. Then the 10 fps image dataset was used for adding further detail into the NN.

Each person became their own unique dataset rather than to sample everyone together in a way similar to the flicker face dataset
